# RASA-Docker
Rasa Open Source Assistant in Docker Compose

This is a demo RASA Chatbot project where scenario of user asking for rights or creating a ticket to helpdesk for rights has been implemented.

As Docker Docs Says,
 ## If you have a newer system, specifically 64bit Windows 10 Pro, with Enterprise and Education (1607 Anniversary update, Build 14393 or later), consider using Docker Desktop for Windows instead.
 
I have deployed RASA Open source using Docker Compose on my system whose configuration is:
- Windows 10 Enterprise
- 16 GB RAM
- 64-Bit OS
- Version: 1703
- OS Build: 15063.1563
- Enabled 'Virtualization' from BIOS Settings.
 
#### Main Files
- docker-compose.yml
- Dockerfile

Just clone this repo, install docker and run command 'docker-compose up', The RASA Server and Action Server will be up and you will be able to interact with the chatbot.
